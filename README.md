# Rosely Documentation

This contains the documentation of the [Rosely](https://github.com/hellotham/Rosely) design system, written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme.

It is currently hosted at [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Cloning the Project

The following will give you a project that is set up and ready to use (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site). The `hugo server` command builds and serves the site. If you just want to build the site, run `hugo` instead.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/hellotham/rosely-docs.git
cd rosely-docs
npm install
hugo server
```
