If ever there was a time when we needed to surround ourselves with colours that infuse feelings of calmness and positivity into our environment,
it is now. As we continue down this path of uncertainty, a time marked by a global pandemic and social distancing coupled with social unrest
demanding action on equality and sustainability, people seek mindfulness and well-being as an antidote to the stress of modern day lives.

Rosely has a base colour that psychologicallys fulfil a yearning for reassurance and security.
Additional colours symbolises the brighter future that lies ahead that expresses a sense of playful freshness and optimism that brings a
smile to our face as it takes us forward.
