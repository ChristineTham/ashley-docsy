Constraint-based design is a term used to describe a technique which allows the designer to experiment with design changes while maintaining a set of imposed limits or constraints. It is also used to describe the technique of varying constraints in order to assess their effect on the function of the system being designed. Constraints may include factors such as size, weight, relationships between elements, types of materials, cost, and function.


In the context of Rosely, the colour palette is deliberatesly restricted in colour hues and contrast.
