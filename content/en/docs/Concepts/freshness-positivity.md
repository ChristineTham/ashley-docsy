In an adventuresome exploration of newness and originality, the design colour palette also includes additional colours that highlight the dichotomy of an intense black with a sugary white and the dramatic impact made by this classic pairing when contrasted against a more vibrant sunny yellow, bold hot pink, delectable raspberry and tangy lime. Adding to the liveliness is a periwinkle blue, a watery turquoise and a cool spearmint green.
