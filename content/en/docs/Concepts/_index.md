If ever there was a time when we needed to surround ourselves with colours that infuse feelings of calmness and positivity into our environment, it is now. As we continue down this path of uncertainty, a time marked by a global pandemic and social distancing coupled with social unrest demanding action on equality and sustainability, people seek mindfulness and well-being as an antidote to the stress of modern day lives.
